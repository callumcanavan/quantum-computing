# quantum-computing

Practice with using [```Qiskit```](https://qiskit.org), an open-source ```Python``` framework for quantum computing. Qiskit Examples contains only examples found in the Qiskit documentation, while Deutsch's Algorithm contains my implementation of a special case of the [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch–Jozsa_algorithm), with tests on a real device.
